### ‚úÖ COPY & PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT AI:

````txt
You are an expert AI developer. Help me build a web app for a construction company called **Lazope Construction Company**. This app is designed to generate and send quotations to clients using Agentic AI principles. It will integrate with **Supabase**, **Google Sheets**, and **n8n** via a webhook.

---

### üîß TECHNOLOGIES:
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS or React (simple form UI)
- Backend: Node.js (Express preferred), using fetch or axios
- External Systems:
  - Supabase (for DB storage)
  - n8n Webhook: https://ngonidzashezimbwa.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/0faf29c7-1eb2-4ece-8a8b-8a2b46cd5d83
  - Google Sheets (for logging quote data)
  - Optional: HTML-to-PDF API (for generating quote PDFs)

---

### üß† GOAL:
To build a modular web system that allows:
1. **Clients or staff** to fill out a quote form
2. **App sends the quote data** to the above n8n webhook
3. n8n handles the rest: stores quote in Supabase, generates PDF, emails client, logs to Google Sheets

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è FRONTEND FORM (Fields):
```plaintext
- Client Name
- Client Email
- Client Phone
- Client Address
- Validity Period (days)
- Terms and Conditions (textarea)
- Services Table (dynamic rows):
  - Description
  - Unit
  - Quantity
  - Unit Price
````

Submit button: `Send Quote`

### üì¶ SAMPLE JSON FORMAT TO POST TO WEBHOOK:

```json
{
  "client_name": "John Moyo",
  "client_email": "john@example.com",
  "client_phone": "+263771234567",
  "client_address": "123 Lazope Street, Harare",
  "quote_number": "LZQ-001",
  "validity_days": 14,
  "terms": "50% upfront before project start",
  "services": [
    {
      "description": "Bricklaying",
      "unit": "m¬≤",
      "quantity": 120,
      "unit_price": 7.50
    },
    {
      "description": "Cement Supply",
      "unit": "bags",
      "quantity": 30,
      "unit_price": 10.00
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### üì° BACKEND LOGIC:

* On form submit, collect form values and send a POST request to the webhook.
* Include logic to generate a unique `quote_number` like `LZQ-001`, `LZQ-002` etc.
* Optionally show a confirmation message or a preview page after sending the data.

---

### ‚úÖ AGENTIC AI STRUCTURE (Internal Modules):

* **Trigger Agent**: Captures input from the form
* **Quote Builder Agent**: Formats and calculates totals
* **Webhook Communicator Agent**: Sends data to n8n
* **Status Notifier Agent**: Displays success/failure to user

---

### üîí SECURITY NOTES:

* Sanitize inputs
* Ensure webhook URL is stored in `.env` file
* Basic rate limiting to avoid spam

---

Let‚Äôs scaffold the entire project with comments and a clean file structure. The app should be easy to host on Replit and link with the n8n workflow above. Name the repo: `lazope-quote-agent`

```

---

Would you like me to **generate the full project code scaffold** (HTML + JS + webhook call) or help build the **PDF template for n8n** next?
